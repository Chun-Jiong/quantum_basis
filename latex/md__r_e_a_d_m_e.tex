Basis of condensed matter quantum lattice problems, for usage in exact diagonalization (ED). The code is designed for any general bosonic or fermionic problem (or a mix of both), as long as the user can provide the \href{Manual.pdf}{\tt matrix form of the elementary operators} of the Hamiltonian.

\subsection*{Examples}

To learn how to use this library to design ED code for your own models, please refer to the folder \char`\"{}examples\char`\"{}\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Chain
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Heisenberg spin-\/1/2
\item Heisenberg spin-\/1
\item Kondo Lattice model
\item t-\/J model
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Honeycomb lattice
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Spinless fermion
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Kagome lattice
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Heisenberg spin-\/1/2
\item t-\/J model
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Square lattice
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Bose-\/\+Hubbard model
\item Fermi-\/\+Hubbard model
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Triangular lattice

\subsection*{Dependencies\+:}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{http://www.boost.org/}{\tt Boost} (Boost lib and Qbasis lib have to be built with compatible compilers)
\item \href{https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl}{\tt M\+KL} (some old versions may not work)
\item \href{https://github.com/opencollab/arpack-ng}{\tt arpack} (dependency to be removed in future)
\item \href{https://github.com/wztzjhn/arpackpp}{\tt arpack++} (dependency to be removed in future)
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries Note\+: using a modified version of arpack++ to be compatible with M\+KL.}

\subsection*{Restrictions on lattice\+:}

When using translational symmetry, at least one of the dimensions (Lx, Ly, Lz, or number of sublattices) has to be an even number (current implementation of the generalized Lin Table).

\subsection*{Parallel scheme\+:}

M\+KL + Open\+MP

\subsection*{Compilation}

Currently the known working compilers are g++, icpc, and clang++ (c++11 required). (openmp in clang++ not tested yet)

The code can be compiled in two modes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 32-\/bit integer
\item 64-\/bit integer (if the unrestricted Hilbert space reaches 10$^\wedge$9, it is necessary to use 64-\/bit mode)
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries In the 64-\/bit mode}\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item arpack has to be compiled with \char`\"{}-\/fdefault-\/integer-\/8\char`\"{}
\item arpack++ has to use the branch \char`\"{}long\char`\"{}
\item linking to M\+KL has to use the I\+L\+P64 mode 
\end{DoxyItemize}
